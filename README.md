# Homework 1 - Marketplace


Chosen solution:
-

The solution represents a basic implementation of the producers / consumers problem in python multithreading.

Consumer / Producer class extend the Thread class and implement the functionality in the run method.

All the marketplace related functions are implemented inside the Marketplace class and they are described 
in detail within the commentaries.

Each Producer / Consumer waits for permission (lock) to access the critical region, and do it's job.

I suppose the homework helped me work on my Python skills and somehow understand how multithreading works in Python mostly, 
but there is not quite a difference between Python and Java.

I don't know how the implementation can be done better, but I'm sure there might be a way to do so. 
I think this implementation is quite good.


Implementation
-

I didn't understand the logging part and I didn't implement it since it was not affecting the result of the tests.
